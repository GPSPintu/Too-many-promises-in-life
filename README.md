# Too-many-promises-in-life


Why on Earth do we need promise.all ?
Answer:- 
Promise.all() is used to wait for multiple promises to resolve, and then perform some action when all of them have completed. It's important because it allows us to write more efficient and readable asynchronous code.

Here are some reasons why promises are important:

Promises make it easier to reason about asynchronous code: Promises provide a way to write code that waits for asynchronous actions to complete, without blocking the main thread. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the code and to write code that is more robust and reliable.

Promises allow us to handle errors more gracefully: With promises, we can use .catch() to handle errors that occur during the execution of asynchronous code. This makes it easier to write code that gracefully handles errors and recovers from them.

Promises simplify complex chains of asynchronous actions: Promises can be chained together, which allows us to write complex asynchronous workflows in a more readable and maintainable way.

Promises can improve performance: Promises allow us to execute multiple asynchronous actions in parallel, which can improve the performance of our code by reducing the amount of time that we spend waiting for individual actions to complete.
